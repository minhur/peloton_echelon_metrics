Fork from https://github.com/ZV3zrmCT/peloton_schwinn_metrics to display Echelon resistance

# About
The Peloton web application does not display target metrics, like cadance and resistance. This bookmarklet uses the Peloton web application and API to display the target metrics. Works in cycling classes only.

# Metrics
- Two resistance ranges are displayed. The first is for the Echelon bike, the second is for Peloton (in paranthesis).
- Live and recently added classes do not have metrics. It can take a day or more for Peloton to add metrics to a recording.
- Metrics begin after the 1 minute warm-up.

# How to use
1. Start a cycling class on the Peloton website.
2. Open the PelotonSchwinn bookmark.
3. Metrics are magically displayed! (after the one minute start/warm-up)

# How to install
paste the source code into https://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/, drag the generated Blue Button link to bookmark
